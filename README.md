# zegaming-website
ZeGaming is a project intended to promote technology within children around Algeria. The program is run by tech education activists with a strong academic background in computer science and engineering.

## How to contribute?
This project is a non-profit initiative by students and fresh graduated professionals that call themselves tech education activists. As we aim to make positive social impact, we can use the maximum help from absolutely anyone who can help!
Inside this repository is a folder called `static` that contains the static html of the website page [http://zegaming.org](http://zegaming.org). You can create other pages, refine and polish the current pages, or simply make spell checks or why not add a language.

Additionally, we aim to make this website a little more interactive and dynamic, this is why we encourage you to make other folders (in addition to `static`) where you can build a Wordpress or Joomla theme. Feel free to use any web technology that you want to learn!

Happy coding :)
